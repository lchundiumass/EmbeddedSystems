Team Suitability: This project very much so suits us because we both have a combined interest in machine learning. Furthermore,
we are both interested in machine learning in regards to embedded systems. Shawn, is an excellent electrical engineer and I ( Lohith )
am skilled in software development. Together I believe that we can not only understand the research that has been conducted on the subject. 
But I believe we can help the community by providing unique and never seen before data sets. We also believe that we have the ability to
be able to convey the knowledge that we learn throughout this project in the best possible way to our class. Me and shawn both have a 
tutoring background, and we have worked together on countless projects in the past. We both know each others strengths and weaknesses, and 
therefore we are organized and efficient. 


Motivation: Our main motivation as stated in the paragraph above, is our dire interest towards the subject of machine learning in an 
embedded environment.
